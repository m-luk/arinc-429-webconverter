# ARINC-429-Converter

App coded in JS combining elements of web programming and aviation.

## How to use it?
* To use ARINC-429 get a little knowledge about [THAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARINC_429).
* Also you can look at [THIS](http://aviftech.com/files/2213/6387/8354/ARINC429_Tutorial.pdf) tutorial.
* To use converter correctly use 32-bit word.

## Contribute
* At the moment we use ESLint (ES6), but ignore "undefined function" and "defined but never used" due to seperate javascript files.
* All comments sholud be place above commented statement, without seperation.

## What to do?
* App needs visual upgrade.
* There really aren't any test, lets create some!
